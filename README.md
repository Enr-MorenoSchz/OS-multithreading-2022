# OS-multithreading-2022
[2nd University Course] 3rd Practice from the Operating Systems subject re-uploaded. Course 2021/2022.

Project Goal: To design and implement in C and for LINUX operating systems, a program that acts as a cost manager of a data processing center. It must be a concurrent multi-threaded system that calculates the cost of utilization of the machines of the processing center; and designed and implemented as a producer-consumer problem.

[Note: This project was never uploaded to my university GitHub account ( @EnriqueMorenoG88 ), so you will only find it here]
